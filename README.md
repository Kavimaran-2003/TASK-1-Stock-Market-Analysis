# CODTHECH TASK-1-Stock-Market-Analysis

Overview

This project involves analyzing stock market data and making predictions using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on utilizing time series analysis and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to forecast stock prices.

Introduction

Stock market prediction is a challenging task that involves the analysis of historical stock prices to predict future movements. This project uses Python libraries and tools to perform time series analysis and build predictive models.

Data

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing historical stock prices. The file includes columns for Date, Close, Volume, Open, High, and Low prices.

Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebooks:

1.pandas

2.numpy

3.seaborn

4.matplotlib

5.statsmodels

6.dateutil

7.scikit-learn

Result

The analysis and predictions are presented in the notebook. Key steps include:

1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Time Series Decomposition

4.Building and Evaluating ARIMA Model
